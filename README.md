# Sudoku Tools (under development)

This project is a research tool made to gain insight and intuition on sudoku transformations. A sudoku transformation is for example to rotate a sudoku, mirror the sudoku, switch all of a given number with all of some other given number, and so on. The important part is that the new sudoku made from the tranformation is also a valid sudoku.

Try it out here: [https://henrikbolafsen.github.io/sudoku-tools/](https://henrikbolafsen.github.io/sudoku-tools/)

I am trying to figure out the relation between different sudokus. And the big question is *Are they all related*?
I have been able to prove this for 4x4 sudokus, but now the question is if this holds true for any NxM sudoku.

The tool is still under development with only some features fully implemented.
